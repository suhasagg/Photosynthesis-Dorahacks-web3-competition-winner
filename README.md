# Movie based NFTs use case 

When it comes to movie-based NFTs, there are several ways that the photosynthesis algorithm could be applied to generate additional revenue streams for Dapps.

One potential application is to use liquidity tokens earned through liquid staking of Archway rewards to mint NFTs based on popular movies. For example, a Dapp could partner with a movie studio or production company to create a series of NFTs featuring scenes or characters from a blockbuster movie. These NFTs could then be sold to collectors and fans, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Dapp and the movie studio.

Another potential application is to use liquidity tokens to fund the production of a movie, or to invest in a movie project that is already in development. In this scenario, the Dapp could use its liquidity tokens to provide financing for the movie in exchange for a share of the profits or a percentage of the movie's revenue. This could potentially be a lucrative investment opportunity for Dapps, especially if the movie becomes a hit and generates significant revenue.

Additionally, Dapps could use liquidity tokens to purchase movie rights or licensing agreements, which would allow them to create and sell NFTs based on popular movies. This could be a particularly attractive option for Dapps that specialize in creating and selling collectible items, as movie-based NFTs could be highly sought after by collectors and fans.

Overall, the photosynthesis algorithm provides a powerful mechanism for Dapps to generate and harness energy in the form of rewards, liquidity, and unique digital assets, including movie-based NFTs.
