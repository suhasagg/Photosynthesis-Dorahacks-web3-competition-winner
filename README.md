### 📝 **Stride Workflow Steps**

1.  **START RELAYER**
2.  **CREATING CONNECTIONS WITH THE GO RELAYER**
3.  **Create connections and channels**:
    *   a) Get channel ID created on the photosynthesis-archway
    *   b) Start Go Relayer
    *   c) IBC Transfer from Photosynthesis-archway to stride (from relayer
        account)
    *   d) Confirm funds were received on stride and get IBC denom
    *   e) Register host zone
    *   f) Add validator
    *   g) Confirm ICA channels were registered
    *   h) Go Through Flow
    *   i) Liquid stake (then wait and LS again)
    *   j) Confirm stTokens, StakedBal, and Redemption Rate
    *   k) Redeem
    *   l) Confirm stTokens and StakedBal
    *   m) Add another validator
    *   n) Liquid stake and confirm the stake was split 50/50 between the
        validators
    *   o) Change validator weights
    *   p) LS and confirm delegation aligned with new weights
    *   q) Update delegations (submit this query and confirm the ICQ callback
        displays in the stride logs)

Application of ML forecasting reports -

1\)Identifying redemption rate trends. Quarter of the day, which hour of the day
is most optimum for redemption.

2\)Identifying liquid tokens obtained trends. Quarter of the day, which hour of
the day is most optimum for liquid staking tokens,to get maximum stuarch.

Contract metadata parameters can be tuned based on ML reports above to optimise
epoch based schedulars.

🔍 Determine Active Host Zones:

Retrieve all active host zones 🌐 where staking and redemption activities can occur.


💹 Calculate & Update Redemption Rates:

For each host zone:
Retrieve associated parameters: stSupply 📊, undelegatedBalance 💼, stakedBalance ⚖️, and moduleAcctBalance 📓.
If stSupply is not zero 🚫:
Calculate the redemption rate 🧮 using the formula:

(Unbonded Balance 💰 + Staked Balance ⚖️ + Module Account Balance 📓) / (stToken Supply 📦)
Store the previous redemption rate 📔 and update with the new redemption rate 🔄.


🪙 Stake Token Creation (Liquid Stake):

A user sends native tokens 💸 to the Stride platform for staking.
Verify the host zone is active ✅ and not halted 🛑.
Check if the redemption rate is within safety bounds 🛡️.
Create the equivalent number of stTokens for the user based on the current redemption rate 🔢.
Log the transaction 📝 with all relevant details.


# 🎯 Saturating redemption rate A/B Test Experiment 🧪 to avoid 🛑 Halting Host Zone Error code 🚫 (This Error code comes if redemption rate for host zone is not within safety 🛡 limits)


🖥 Halted Host Zone Algorithm Explanation🖥

✅ IsRedemptionRateWithinSafetyBounds: This function checks if the redemption rate of a given host zone is within the predefined safety bounds. It first fetches the default safety thresholds and then adjusts them if the host zone provides custom values. If the redemption rate of the zone is outside of these bounds, it logs an error and returns false.

📦 BeginBlocker: At the beginning of every block, this function checks the redemption rate of all host zones. If any host zone has a redemption rate outside of the safety bounds, it halts that host zone and adds its associated asset to a blacklist 🚫.

💧 LiquidStake: This function allows a user to liquid stake their native tokens in exchange for stTokens using the current redemption rate. The function has several safety checks including ensuring the host zone is valid, the redemption rate is within safety bounds, and the user has a sufficient balance.

🔄 RedeemStake: This function enables a user to redeem their liquid staked tokens. It does so by:

- Validating the provided addresses and host zone.
- Checking if the host zone is halted.
- Constructing a user redemption record.
- Performing a variety of safety checks, including ensuring the redemption rate is within safety bounds and the user has a sufficient balance.

🎯 Objective:
The main aim of the experiment seems to be simulating the saturation of redemption rates in a liquid staking blockchain scenario. This means when the host zone (Photosynthesis - Archway chain responsible for handling liquid staking and redemption) is operational for extended periods, it is anticipated that the periodic liquid staking will increase the liquid stake, while the subsequent redemptions will decrease it. The experiment seems to aim to understand when (or if) the redemption rate reaches saturation.

📈 Analysis and Anticipation:
The experiment's flow appears to involve periods of liquid staking (increasing liquid tokens) and periods of redemption (decreasing liquid tokens). By observing this cycle over extended periods, the goal is to see if a point of saturation is reached.

The results are used to provide insights into how the liquid staking blockchain system (stride) behaves under continuous staking and redemption scenarios, helping to understand its scalability, sustainability, and potential bottlenecks, providing training data for Redemption rate based ML models.

🤖 Training an ML Model:
Over time, these operations generate a wealth of data on liquid staking, redemption, liquidity distribution, and other relevant transactions. This data will be essential to train a Machine Learning model, which will:

 📊 Forecast: Predict future behaviors and trends related to liquid staking and redemption rates based on historical data.
🔧 Optimization: Based on the forecasts, the model can suggest optimal strategies to maintain a balanced and efficient redemption rate, ensuring the liquid staking blockchain system operates smoothly.

The combination of liquid staking blockchain operations and ML forecasting provide a robust system that not only operates efficiently but also predicts and optimizes future behaviors. Through continuous learning and adaptation, the system can potentially handle a growing number of Dapps and transactions while maintaining performance.

📅 Longer Photosynthesis-Archway blockchain run is simulated using the following cron schedule simulating periods of liquid staking (increasing liquid tokens) and periods of redemption (decreasing liquid tokens) over longer time.

The described cron schedule simulates a longer run of the Photosynthesis-Archway blockchain with different jobs (described in cron) that are related to liquid staking.
The cron job frequencies have been designed to mimic the natural ebb and flow of a liquid staking blockchain network over a long run. By running certain tasks like rewards withdrawal and liquid staking more frequently, it simulates a busy network with constant liquid staking. Meanwhile, less frequent tasks like redeeming stakes or distributing redeemed tokens represent larger, periodic operations that might not happen as often but have significant impact on redemption rate and other parameters.


# Protocol to provide protection against filesystem tampering attacks 🔐 (file set consists of Photosynthesis-Archway chain logs and files utilized by cron jobs)

Filesystem integrity checks and a validator selection algorithm into the cron/chain logs indexing job execution process.

Steps to verify filesystem data across validators and decide how a validator is chosen to perform the actual job execution. The filesystem data is critical and must be consistent across all validators.

# Protocol with Filesystem Integrity and Validator Selection

1. Filesystem Snapshot and Hashing 📸🔍

Before the run, validator takes a snapshot of the relevant filesystem data and computes a cryptographic hash of this snapshot. This hash represents the state of the data that the cron/chain logs indexing job will use.

2. Share Filesystem Hashes 🔄📊

Validators share their hashed results by indexing in ES Data Store.
Along with the hash, validators share a digital signature to ensure the result's authenticity.
Filesystem state is verified. This step ensures all validators agree on the data state before executing the job.

3. External Script Filesystem Integrity Verification 🛠️📈

Validators upload their filesystem hashes and metadata to a designated ES index.

A third-party script (audit tool) periodically queries the ES index to retrieve the filesystem hashes and metadata from all validators.

The script performs the following actions:

Analysis: It compares the hashes across validators to determine consistency.
Majority Consensus: The script determines if there is a majority consensus on the filesystem state.

Logging: For each validator, the script logs:
The validator's ID.
The verification result (consistent/inconsistent with the majority).
The hash value that was compared.
A timestamp of when the analysis was performed.
The script also logs a summary report indicating overall filesystem state consistency and any deviations found.

4. Verified Filesystem State  ✅📁
Only after filesystem integrity is verified, validators proceed with the execution of the cron/indexing job, using the data from the filesystem snapshot that passed the integrity check.

5. Validator Selection Algorithm for Actual Execution 🎲🏅

Below algorithm fairly and transparently chooses a validator for the actual job execution. The algorithm chooses validators based on below parameters combination with weights in sorted order.

Stake-Based: Validators with more at stake (reputation, uptime, etc.) 

Performance-Based: Validators with the best performance history are prioritized.

Round-Robin: Each validator takes turns in a predefined order.

Random Selection: Validators are chosen at random, ensuring unpredictability.

6. Actual Job Execution with Verified Filesystem 🚀💾
The selected validator then performs the actual job execution, having the verified filesystem data.

7. Continuous Filesystem Monitoring 🕵️‍♂️🖥️
Validators continuously monitor the filesystem integrity to detect and resolve discrepancies proactively.

8. Error Handling, Alerting, and Validator Replacement 🚨🔄
If filesystem inconsistencies persist, or if a validator fails to execute jobs correctly, an alerting mechanism flags these issues.
Validators may be replaced based on the selection algorithm's criteria, taking into account their integrity and performance metrics.

🌐Flow with Filesystem Integrity and Validator Selection🌐

1)Job A requires data from the filesystem, so Validators 1, 2, and 3 compute and share hashes of the data state.
2)After verifying filesystem integrity, Validators proceed with the run of Job A.
3)Validator 2 is chosen for actual execution based on the selection algorithm.
Validator 2 executes Job A.


# Advantages of using cron jobs vs cosmwasm rust smart contracts 


# Periodic Execution:	


Smart contracts: Smart contracts can be designed to trigger actions at predetermined intervals, but this will require external triggers or complex/customized on-chain logic. 
(epoch, x/cw-callback), this might not be as precise as script schedulers available, put stress on existing Dapps. 🔄


Cron job: Cron jobs are inherently designed for periodic execution, allowing precise scheduling of tasks. ⏰


# Gas Fees:	


Smart Contracts: Executing smart contracts will incur Photosynthesis-Archway chain gas fees, which might be significant depending on the frequency of different jobs.💸


Cron job: Running scripts on validators will not directly incur Photosynthesis-Archway chain transaction fees. 🆓


# Resource Usage:

Smart contracts: execute on Photosynthesis-Archway chain, utilizing network resources. Resource-intensive tasks can be costly and may impact network performance. 🌐


Cron job: Resource usage is confined to the individual validator nodes. The impact on the overall network is minimal, validator selection algorithm ensures a safe validator node.💻


# Scalability:	


Smart contracts: Scaling smart contract operations can be challenging and expensive, especially on heavily utilized networks. ⚖️


Cron job: Scalability is dependent on the infrastructure capabilities of individual validators. 📈


# Job Update Flexibility:	


Smart Contracts: Updating smart contracts can be complex and requires redeploying new contracts. Not always agile for frequent updates, parameters tuning. 🔄


Cron job: Relatively easy to update scripts and adjust schedules. Offers more agility for frequent changes, updates, customization, parameters tuning. ✏️



# Retry Logic Flexibility:


1)Ease of Implementation:

Smart Contracts:
Retry logic in smart contracts must be explicitly coded, considering various failure scenarios. 🤔

Cron jobs:
It’s easier to implement and modify retry logic in cron jobs, as changes can be made directly in the script. 🔄



2)Cost:

Smart Contracts:
The retry mechanism must account for gas costs and network load, potentially complicating the implementation. 💸

Cron jobs:
Since they execute on a server, the retry logic in cron jobs doesn't incur additional costs. 🆓



3)Adaptability: 🔄✅

Smart Contracts:
Once deployed, altering the retry logic of a smart contract requires deploying a new version, which can be cumbersome.
Implementing retry logic in smart contracts can be complex. It requires careful planning and coding to handle failures or exceptions gracefully.

Cron jobs:
Cron jobs can be quickly adapted to handle retries in various ways, such as immediate retries, delayed retries, or conditional retries based on specific error types.



3)Precision:

# 🎯 Strategy: Buffered Staking Approach with Grace Limits


🥅 Objective: To maximize staking rewards while avoiding redemption rate extremes and ensuring a smooth user experience.


🚦 Guiding Principles:


1️⃣ Optimal Utilization: Maximize the usage of the 7 unbondings within the 21-day period.


2️⃣ Buffered Operations: Incorporate the 4-day processing window by Stride to maintain system stability and ensure user experience.


3️⃣ Graceful Rate Limits: Ensure operations don't push the redemption rate to its extreme boundaries (below 1.05 or above 1.45).


📅 Strategy Execution:


🌱 Phase 1: Active Staking Phase

| Day | Redemption Rate (%) | Action |
|-----|---------------------|--------|
| 1-3 | 1.05 to 1.15       | 💼 Stake(uarch)  |
| 4   | 1.15 to 1.25       | ❌ -      | (Buffer Day: No activity) |
| 5-7 | 1.25 to 1.35       | 💼 Stake(uarch)  |
| 8   | 1.35 to 1.4        | ❌ -      | (Buffer Day: No activity) |
| 9-11| 1.4 to 1.45        | 💼 Stake(uarch)  |
| 12  | 1.45               | ❌ -      | (Buffer Day: No activity) |


💰 Phase 2: Scheduled Unbonding Phase

| Day | Redemption Rate (%)  | Action |
|-----|--------------------- |--------|
| 13-15 | 1.45               | 💸 Redeem(stuarch) (Initiate Unbonding) |
| 16    | 1.45               | ❌ -      | (Buffer Day: No activity) |
| 17-19 | 1.45               | 💸 Redeem(stuarch) (Initiate Unbonding) |
| 20    | 1.45               | ❌ -      | (Buffer Day: No activity) |
| 21    | 1.45               | 💸 Redeem(stuarch) (Final Unbonding)    |


✨ Benefits:


1️⃣ Staking With Graceful Limits: Assets are staked when the redemption rate is climbing and stays within a buffered boundary. Liquid stake (uarch) rewards when redemption rates are at their lowest to maximize returns and achieve the best buy rate.


2️⃣ Buffered Unbonding: The unbonding process respects the 4-day cycle with a buffer day to account for any operational challenges.


3️⃣ Regular Redemption Below Max: Unbonding is initiated at a rate below the absolute maximum, ensuring there's sufficient buffer against rate saturation.


By introducing the grace limits and adhering to the 4-day cycle imposed by Stride, this strategy aims to offer the best balance between earning potential and operational stability. It respects the constraints while optimizing for maximum return during the favorable redemption rate period. 📈🔐👌

Archway protocol.

Liquid tokens can be beneficial in the context of the Cookie Sync application as
they can provide liquidity to the platform and incentivize users to participate
in the ecosystem. In this case, the PLT token can be used as a liquid token that
is used to incentivize users to sync their cookies across different chains.

Users who sync their cookies can be rewarded with PLT tokens, which can then be
used to participate in governance and decision-making processes on the platform.
Additionally, PLT tokens can be traded on decentralized exchanges, which
provides liquidity to the platform and allows users to realize the value of
their contributions.

By using liquid tokens, the platform can incentivize user participation and
engagement, which can lead to increased adoption and usage of the platform. This
can also help to build a strong and supportive community around the platform,
which can be beneficial in the long term.
