The V13 update is Juno's largest update, bringing many new features for
developers, users, and relayers.

*   [x/GlobalFee](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/411)
*   [More ICA Messages](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/436/files)
*   [Governance Spam Prevention](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/394)
*   [x/wasmd 30](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/387)
*   [x/ibc V4](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/387)
*   [x/ibc-fees](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/432)

V13 is targeted at developers with relayer and user experience improvements as
well.

**FeeShare** will allow contract developers to receive 50% of gas fees executed
on their contract. Providing an alternative income source for new business use
cases. This also enhances current business models to support developers & grow
the ecosystem further.

The **TokenFactory** will make developers' lives easier, and also make querying
users' [DAO](https://daodao.zone/) tokens via MintScan and Keplr possible. By
default, CosmWasm smart contracts accept native tokens. However, the only
initial native tokens are the staking demons for most chains. This gives the
ability for a user to create their token, and manage the tokenomics behind it.
Then accept it just as they would any other denomination via the standard
[x/bank](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/bank) module.

Speaking of relayers, **IBCFees** now helps to fund those who relayer your
packets! In the above paragraph, we mention how IBC transfers are feeless for
relayers. Fees can still be sent with these packets and bring some income for
relayers, thus maintaining public goods infrastructure. The relayers still have
to pay the fee on the other chain's token, but this is a positive step in the
right direction for variables we can control.
